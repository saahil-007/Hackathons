# Appointment System

## Admin Credentials

Since admin registration is restricted for security, use the following pre-seeded credentials to log in as an Admin:

- **Email**: `admin@example.com`
- **Password**: `adminpassword123`

### Setting up the Admin User
If the admin user does not exist in your database, run the following command in the `server` directory:

```bash
npm run data:import
```

This will create the initial admin user.
